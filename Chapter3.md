## Chapter 3. Data Processing for the Mississippi Bridge Data

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we process GPR data from the actual Mississippi bridge to locate rebar configuration. The bridge name is I-10 over CEDAR LAKE ROAD, built-in 1970. The bridge type is a Prestressed Concrete Girder/Beam. The length of the bridge is 242.50 and the width is 59.40 ft, respectively.

### Step 1. Outlier removal via interquartile range (IQR) method

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the same `read_csv` function from the previous chapter, we are making 2 Pandas data frame: GPR data and configuration. We noticed that there are some outlier values on the GPR data, so we removed them by the interquartile range (IQR) method. The IQR method is a statistical technique used to identify and remove outliers from a dataset. It involves calculating the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of the data distribution. Outliers are then identified and removed based on a specified multiplier of the IQR. This method is effective in addressing skewed or non-normally distributed data by focusing on the central portion of the dataset. A more detailed explanation is in our code description of the `Interquartile_Range`.

### Step 2. Gain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We observed that the GPR signal isn't sufficiently clear for processing (see Figure 14 (a) and (c)), likely because the first peak amplitude significantly outweighs other signals. This disparity could be attributed to the GPR settings or signal attenuation. To address this issue, we employ a gain function to better highlight the reflected signal. We introduce two methods, namely power gain and exponential gain, <a href="https://emanuelhuber.github.io/RGPR/02_RGPR_tutorial_basic-GPR-data-processing/">[12]</a> to enhance the clarity of the reflected signal. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power gain function is defined as follows,

$$
x_g(t) = x(t) \cdot t^ \alpha.
$$

The signal $x(t)$ is multiplied by $t^ \alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the exponent. In the default case, $\alpha$ is set to 1. The effect of the power gain is to amplify the signal based on a power-law relationship with time $t$. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exponential gain function is defined as,

$$
x_g(t) = x(t) \cdot \exp(\alpha \cdot t).
$$

Here, $\exp(\alpha \cdot t)$ represents the exponential function with $\alpha$ as the exponent. The signal $x(t)$ is multiplied by this exponential term. The exponential gain introduces a time-dependent exponential factor to the signal. Adjusting the $\alpha$ parameter allows control over the rate of amplification, impacting the signal characteristics. We applied the power gain function with $\alpha = 0.2$ only after the initial positive and negative peaks for improved visibility and processing.

### Step 3. Dewow

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dewow is used to mitigate the effects of low-frequency variations, or "wows," in the GPR signal. The terminology is derived from the nature of the low-frequency variations or oscillations that it aims to mitigate—resembling a slow, undulating motion, akin to the exclamation "wow." Wows can result from various factors, such as uneven ground surfaces or fluctuations in the system. Dewow processing involves filtering or removing these low-frequency components from the GPR signal to enhance the clarity and resolution of subsurface features. This technique helps improve the overall quality of GPR data by reducing unwanted variations. Here we used trinomial dewow <a href="https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/blob/master/readgssi/functions.py">[13]</a> to correct the baseline of each A-scan.

### Step 4. Time Zero Correction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the processed data (outlier removal, gain, and dewow), we are applying the scan-by-scan time-zero correction.

### Step 5. Migration

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We apply F-K migration based on the time-zeroed data.

### Step 6. Pinpoint Rebars

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use the K-means clustering algorithm used in the previous chapter to pinpoint rebar locations.

### Step 7. Discussion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We successfully processed the actual concrete bridge GPR data by processing the outliers with IQR, applying gain to amplify the reflection signals, adjusting the A-scan baseline with dewow, leveraging the scan-by-scan time-zero correction, F-K migration, and K-means clustering algorithm to pinpoint the rebar locations. It is noteworthy that GPR data processing requires a deep understanding of each data processing method, and the workers should be able to adjust or apply variables or types of the function with respect to the data characteristics.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limitation to our work lies in the F-K migration. It assumes the dielectric to be constant for all media, which is hard to assume. Notably, the approximate dielectric value used in F-K migration is from the GPR configuration settings, which are defined by the user. This means if the actual data collector sets the value as default, the migration results can be significantly distorted or underestimated. We currently working on how to automate to set the estimated dielectric based only on the migration results.
